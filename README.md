# tales
A Game Developed by me in Python language, using Pygame. The game is still on early, so donÂ´t expect much. All the images, sprites and animations were done by me, and obsviously, the code too.

Tales is an early project of mine, that I started wanting to know more about game dev and python. I've been working really hard on this by a month and a half, and I do want to take this project further. However, for now, the code may be a little confusing, cause I'm too lazy to organize it (and my back hurts :p), but I will work on this!

The game is all programmed in English, however, the texts that are in the game were made in brazilian Portuguese. There aren't too many dial0ogues, so I'm not really worried to change that. But I will.

There are lot of things that  I want to do in this game, but I'm taking baby steps yet. I will upload more content about how the game is going on my patreon page, so check it out. ---> https://patreon.com/Tatsuo543?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&utm_source=copyLink&utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&utm_content=join_link
