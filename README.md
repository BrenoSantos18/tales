    <h1>Tales of The Great Warrior</h1>
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p> Tales is a game project by me, using 100% Pygame, with no engine. I did all the code and art for now, and probably, I will deal with the sounds too.</p
    <p> Tales is the second project of mine, but the biggest without a doubt. The first one was made in Ruby, a game played in terminal without any graphics, that I've already uploaded in my GitHub.</p>
    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <p>The game is still really eraly, but I've already programmed the base of the whole thing, like combat, change between maps, interaction with the scenary etc. However, there is a lot coming soon!</p>
    <p>The game follows the main character (who i haven't decide if he will have a fixed name or a input name) who came to Fortlkand, the map of the game, searching for his childhood friend, that went missing when they were just kids. He tought he was dead, but sure he wasn't.</p>
    <p>The game takes a medieval scenario, and if my plans goes well, there will be a lot of paths that you can go, and you won't need to be trapped by the main history. But that is to the future, right?</p>
     <p>There are of things that  I want to do in this game, but I'm taking baby steps yet. I will upload more content about how the game is going on my patreon page, so check it out!
